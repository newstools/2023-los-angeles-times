Music’s biggest night returns to Los Angeles on Sunday, and along with it, one of Hollywood’s grandest red carpets. From Jennifer Lopez’s now-iconic plunging green Versace dress to Lady Gaga’s celestial Armani Privé gown, fashion history is often made on the Grammys red carpet.

Other musicians set to take the red carpet by storm include Taylor Swift, Harry Styles, Doja Cat, Lizzo, Camila Cabello, Anitta, Bad Bunny, Mary J. Blige and Kim Petras.
