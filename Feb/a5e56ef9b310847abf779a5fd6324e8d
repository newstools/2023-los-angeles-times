After Stephen “Twitch” Boss died without a will, his wife and dance partner, Allison Holker, has filed a petition in Los Angeles for his half of their shared estate. Holker, whose legal name is Allison Boss,  on Wednesday submitted routine court documents proving that she was married to Boss and that he did not have a will. Boss, a beloved dancer and DJ for “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” died by suicide on Dec. 13. He was 40. According to the petition, Holker is seeking Boss’ half of their community property, including his eponymous production company’s investment account, as well as royalties from his work with Disney and the Screen Actors Guild. Holker’s filing states that Boss’ net worth when they married was “nil,” and therefore the assets outlined in the petition are “community property ... by virtue of the fact that they were acquired during the marriage.”  Boss and Holker wed on Dec. 10, 2013, in Paso Robles, Calif. The former “So You Think You Can Dance” contestants shared three children: Weslie, 14; Maddox, 6; and Zaia, 3. “To my husband, best friend, babe, Chee-chalker, Superman and father of my children I LOVE YOU FOREVER and ALWAYS!” Holker wrote last month on Instagram. “We will forever remember you as the true beacon of light that you were and we will continue to cast your light and love throughout the world. Thank you for our incredible memories and our beautiful life shared together.”
