Charisma Osborne had 23 points, Londynn Jones added 20 off the bench, and No. 14 UCLA pulled away in the second half, defeating Arizona State 82-63 on Sunday to end a three-game losing streak. Osborne made seven of 15 shots, including four of seven three-pointers, and was five of five from the free-throw line. She added five rebounds and four assists. Jones shot five of eight, made four of six three-pointers, and was perfect in five free-throw attempts for the third 20-point game of her freshman season. Gabriela Jaquez added 14 points off the bench for the Bruins (18-6, 7-5 Pac-12), who had a 42-6 advantage in bench scoring. Two free throws from Jones and a three-pointer by Jaquez gave the Bruins a 52-40 lead with 2:44 remaining in the third period. ASU’s Tyi Skinner hit a three-pointer — her third of the period — in the final minute of the quarter to get the Sun Devils within 57-48 heading to the fourth. Jones scored the first five points of the fourth and Osborne scored another five soon after, putting the Bruins ahead 67-50 with 7:33 remaining. The lead reached 20 a couple of minutes later when Camryn Brown hit a jumper for a 71-51 advantage.  The Sun Devils got within 15 points once in the final minutes — on a three-pointer by Treasure Hunt with 2:40 remaining — but would get no closer. Skinner scored 28 points, Hunt 18 and Jaddan Simmons 10 for the Sun Devils (7-14, 0-12), who have lost 12 straight — the fifth-longest active streak in the nation. A three-pointer by Jones gave the Bruins their first lead, 13 — 11 with 1:48 remaining in the first quarter and the Bruins led 15-13 after one. UCLA held the lead throughout the second quarter but never by more than six. A three-pointer by Jaquez gave the Bruins a 35-29 lead at halftime.  UCLA hosts Oregon State on Friday and Arizona State hosts California, also on Friday.
