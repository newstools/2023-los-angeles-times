It’s hard to gain entry or an invite to the annual Clive Davis pre-Grammy gala. This year’s event at the Beverly Hilton on Saturday included performances from Maneskin, Lizzo, Sheryl Crow, Jennifer Hudson, Frankie Valli, Lauren Daigle, Latto, Lil Baby and Lil Wayne. “This one night, we still break bread, we celebrate the music that basically and forever bonds us all,” said record producer Davis. “There are no awards. There are no winners or losers tonight. It’s just our passion that makes our heart beat faster. It makes our life so much more greatly purposed with joy and fulfillment.”
