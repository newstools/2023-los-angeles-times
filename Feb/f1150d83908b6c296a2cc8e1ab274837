Emily Bessoir hit four three-pointers and finished with 20 points, Londynn Jones scored 17 points and No. 18 UCLA held on to beat Oregon 67-57 on Sunday, handing the Ducks their fifth consecutive loss. Oregon (14-11, 5-9 Pac-12) has lost six of its last seven games and is in the midst of its longest skid since the 2015-16 campaign — coach Kelly Graves’ second season with the program. UCLA (19-6, 8-5) has won three games in a row after a three-game skid. Charisma Osborne added 13 points, six assists, five rebounds and three steals for the Bruins.  Endyia Rogers scored seven points in an 11-4 run, including a three-pointer that capped the spurt, to tie the score at 55-all with three minutes to play. The Ducks missed their final five field-goal attempts from there. Kiki Rice answered with a layup that gave UCLA the lead for good, Bessoir scored in the lane and Jones followed with a layup for a 61-55 lead with 1:47 remaining. Grace VanSlooten made two free throws 20 seconds later, but Osborne sandwiched a layup and a free throw around a three-pointer by Bessoir to cap the scoring. Rogers led Oregon with 19 points on seven-of-11 shooting. VanSlooten and Chance Gray added 13 points apiece. Te-Hina Paopao, who came in averaging 11.6 points per game, finished with a season-low two points on one-of-nine shooting.
