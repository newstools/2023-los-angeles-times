Tyler Seguin scored Dallas’ second shootout goal, and the Stars beat the Ducks 3-2 on Monday night. Nils Lundkvist and Roope Hintz scored in regulation for Dallas, and Jason Robertson also scored in the shootout. The Stars dropped three straight 3-2 games in overtime before the All-Star break. “When you look at the entirety of the game, we did some really good things,” Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. Dallas goaltender Jake Oettinger made 33 saves. He also stopped Adam Henrique in the third and final shootout round, ending the game. Oettinger, who went into play tied for second in the league with a 2.26 goals-against average, is 5-0-0 against Anaheim. Henrique and Jakob Silfverberg scored in regulation for the Ducks, who had won a season-best three in a row. Mason McTavish scored in the shootout.  Anaheim’s John Gibson stopped 39 shots through overtime. “He’s our star player,” Silfverberg said, “and he showed that tonight.” The Stars went 0 for 5 with the man advantage, including coming up empty on a five-on-three opportunity in the closing minutes of the second period. The Ducks are last in the Pacific Division with 38 points, on course for their fifth consecutive losing season.  “I think when you’re in a rebuild like this, it’s easy to get down and check out once you get behind,” Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said, “but our guys seem to keep battling not only for the team but for each other.“ Lundkvist scored on a backdoor pass through the low slot from Radek Faksa out of the left corner at 8:28 of the first period. Lundkvist was a healthy scratch in four of Dallas’ five previous games.  Hintz tipped in a pass from the left boards by Denis Gurianov, making it 2-0 at 7:35 of the second period. Silfverberg and Henrique scored in an 86-second span midway through the third, tying it at 2. It was Silfverberg’s sixth goal of the season and No. 19 for Henrique.
