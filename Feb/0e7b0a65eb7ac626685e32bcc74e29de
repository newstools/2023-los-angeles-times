For the first time in Super Bowl  history, an all-female team of U.S. Navy aviators will conduct the pregame flyover, commemorating 50 years of women pilots in the military branch. The historic team will fly the four-aircraft formation over State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., at the conclusion of the national anthem, according to the Navy. Seven female aviators will operate the fighter aircraft, with a majority female crew working on and maintaining the planes. “It’s not a feeling I can even put into words,” Lt. Katie Martinez, a flight officer assigned to one of the squadrons working on an aircraft in the flyover, said in a statement. “It doesn’t get bigger than the Super Bowl, and I am humbled and honored to be able to participate with my friends and fellow naval aviators as part of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” The formation will include two F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter jets, one F-35C Lightning II stealth combat aircraft and one EA-18G Growler electronic attack jet, which will depart from nearby Luke Air Force Base, officials said.  Palmdale native and USC  graduate Lt. Lyndsay Evans will be one of those in the historic flyover as  electronic warfare officer in the two-person Growler. Evans joined the Navy eight years ago. “I joined the Navy to serve my country,” the Southern California native said. “Serving in the Navy means being part of something bigger than yourself.” Eight women became the first female candidates to enter U.S. Navy flight school in 1973, and a year later  six graduated to earn their wings.  They become known as “The First Six.” Here are the women who will make air history Sunday. Flying the two F/A-18F Super Hornets: Flying the EA 18G Growler: Flying the F-35C Lightning II:
