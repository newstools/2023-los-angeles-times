The Lakers traded guard Patrick Beverley to the Orlando Magic for center Mo Bamba on Thursday, the team announced. The Lakers view Bamba as a quality backup big man they need in the wake of trading backup center Thomas Bryant to the Denver Nuggets for Davon Reed and three second-round draft picks. Bamba, 24, gives the Lakers a 7-footer who is a solid three-point shooter, having made 39.8% from deep in 40 games with the Magic, including six starts. He was averaging 7.3 points on 49.5% shooting and 4.6 rebounds. Bryant starred as a fill-in for Anthony Davis while the All-Star forward was recovering from foot injuries. Bryant is averaging 12.1 points and 6.8 rebounds per game, far outplaying the one-year minimum deal he signed this offseason. Itâ€™s why, sources said, the Lakers began to find Bryant a new home while getting needed draft picks in return. The team was also looking to find more minutes for Wenyen Gabriel as a backup center in smaller lineups. LeBron James and newly acquired Jarred Vanderbilt also give them small-ball center options. The Lakers will receive second-round picks in 2025, 2026 and 2029. The team, according to people with knowledge of the situation, will be active in the free-agent and buyout markets as it tries to add a bulkier center after it traded Damian Jones in a three-team deal Wednesday that landed point guard D'Angelo Russell, guard Malik Beasley and Vanderbilt.
