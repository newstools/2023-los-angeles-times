You make the world motile, desert enginespushing out to sea, heat and dust and pollensin a frenzied bacchanal, each tree, howeverungainly, doing its best imitation of the willow.Not all can bend and sway with impunity,though it’s a pretty sight and if looks were all(in lieu of most) we could applaud politely,without symptom. Ill-willed wind, your effecton nose, throat, head, makes pummeling the dayinto submission more onerous than usual —more Alp than hill, more Sisyphus thanJack and Jill. Listen to the planes rising steeplybackwards, over inland empires instead of ocean-bound — that’s your doing, too, just when morningswere becoming precise, crispness in the air,each leaf, bloom and needle in its placeas though the Whittler carved them nightly. Patty Seyburn is a professor at Cal State Long Beach and a poet who has published five collections of poems, most recently “Threshold Delivery” and “Perfecta.”
