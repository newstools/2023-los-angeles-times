Sierra Canyon High fans can heave a sigh of relief after the Southern Section included the Trailblazers among eight teams selected for the Open Division boysâ€™ basketball playoffs on Friday. Sierra Canyon lost three of its last five games but came close to beating top teams Sherman Oaks Notre Dame (twice) and Harvard-Westlake. Bronny James returned to the Trailblazers lineup earlier this week and Isaiah Elohim could return next week when the playoffs begin. The other seven teams selected were Harvard-Westlake, Notre Dame, Corona Centennial, West Ranch, St. John Bosco, St. Bernard and Bishop Montgomery. Seedings and pairings will be announced Sunday when the complete playoff brackets are released.
