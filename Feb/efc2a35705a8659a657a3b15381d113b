A gunman opened fire Monday night at Michigan State University, killing three people and wounding five more, and police urged frightened students and others to shelter in place as they searched for the suspect. Hundreds of officers were scouring the East Lansing campus, about 90 miles northwest of Detroit, for the suspect, who police described as a short Black man with red shoes, a jean jacket and ball cap. “There are three confirmed fatalities. This is in addition to the five victims who have been transported to the hospital,” campus police said on Twitter. The shootings began shortly before 8:30 p.m. at Berkey Hall, an academic building, and also occurred nearby at the student union, a popular gathering spot, said Chris Rozman, interim deputy chief of the campus police department. Students were ordered to shelter in place for hours. Rozman urged parents to stay away. “I can only imagine the emotion that’s involved right now. ... We are doing everything we can to ensure the safety of our campus and all of our students,” he said.  The five victims were taken to Sparrow Hospital, said hospital spokesperson John Foren, who had no information on their conditions.         By 10:15 p.m., police said Berkey, as well as nearby residence halls, were secured. Separately, police on Twitter reported a shooting at IM East, a recreational center for students. But Rozman didn’t mention it during a news briefing and said there had been false reports of additional shootings. Aedan Kelley, a junior who lives a half-mile (less than a kilometer) east of campus, said he locked his doors and covered his windows “just in case.” Sirens were constant, he said, and a helicopter hovered overhead.  “It’s all very frightening,” Kelley said. “And then I have all these people texting me wondering if I’m OK, which is overwhelming.” The East Lansing High School auditorium, where a school board meeting was being held Monday night, was locked down and people were being prevented by police from leaving, the Lansing State Journal reported. The East Lansing campus of Michigan State has about 50,000 students. The city is about 90 miles northwest of Detroit.
