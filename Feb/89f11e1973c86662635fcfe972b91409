Fresh mushrooms, dried porcini mushrooms and miso give this pasta dish with cashew cream plenty of umami. Simple and delicious, it works as an appetizer or a main course. The ribbons of red chard add color and texture, and the chard stems add some crunch. Oh, and by the way, it is vegan. Serve sprinkled with plenty of nutritional yeast or (for the nonvegans) Parmesan cheese alongside a big green salad.
