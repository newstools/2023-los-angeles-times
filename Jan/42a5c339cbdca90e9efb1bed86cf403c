No Juju, no problem for Skye Belker of Windward. When Juju Watkins left for Sierra Canyon before last season, Skye Belker was left behind to pick up the pieces. She has gone from a pass-first point guard to one of the top scoring threats in Southern California girls’ basketball. She kept delivering again and again Tuesday night, scoring a career-high 39 points to lift Windward to a 73-62 win over Brentwood in a game for first place in the Gold Coast League. Belker made only two threes, showing she can go to the hoop when needed. “The lane just opened,” she said. Averaging 23 points and headed to Princeton, Belker is doing whatever her new coach, Jerica Williams, asks. “She’s special,” Williams said. Brentwood dropped to 17-4 and 3-1. Windward improved to 14-5 and 4-0. Sierra Canyon 70, Marlborough 44: With Watkins sitting out because of an ankle injury, the Trailblazers still improved to 20-0. Mackenly Randolph had 24 points and 14 rebounds.  Mater Dei 71, Rosary 50: The Monarchs (20-2, 4-0) were led by Addie Deal, who scored 25 points.  Windward 81, Brentwood 63: Making 11 threes and getting major contributions from five sophomores, Windward (18-6, 3-1) served notice it’s making steady progress with an impressive upset at Brentwood to move into a tie for first place in the Gold Coast League.
