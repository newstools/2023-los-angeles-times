Mexican immigration authorities said they found 57 Guatemalan adolescents packed into a trailer on a highway near the U.S. border Thursday. The National Immigration Institute said the 43 boys and 14 girls were crammed into the truckâ€™s trailer, along with eight men and a woman and her daughter. All of the adolescents were considered unaccompanied minors, meaning they had no relatives or parents with them. The vehicle was stopped for inspection on a highway leading to the northern border city of Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso. The driver of the vehicle was detained. The minors were taken to a child welfare facility. Children are frequently smuggled through Mexico to join parents or relatives who have already immigrated to the United States.
