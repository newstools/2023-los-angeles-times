Four dunks. Five threes. A 40-point performance. Just another night of basketball success for 6-foot-8 senior Marcus Adams Jr. of Narbonne High as he tries to make the Gauchos the No. 1 seed for the City Section Open Division playoffs. The Gauchos (15-8, 8-0) clinched the Marine League championship with a 77-67 victory over host San Pedro on Friday night.

He was benched in the first quarter after coach Kumase Demesma didn’t like what he saw. Maximo got the message, and all his points came in the final three quarters.
