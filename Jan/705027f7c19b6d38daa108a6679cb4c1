As the Golden Globes emerge from a cloud of controversy, another cloud hangs over Tuesday’s awards show as relentless storms continue to ravage California. Rain or shine, the show will go on: A tent has been put over the red carpet to keep event-goers dry. The unofficial kickoff to awards season is sure to attract some of the biggest names in film and television (despite last year’s boycott), with nominees that include red carpet mavens Viola Davis, Selena Gomez, Margot Robbie, Michelle Yeoh, Ana de Armas, Michelle Williams, Jessica Chastain, Anya Taylor-Joy, Kaley Cuoco, Salma Hayek and Claire Danes. Andrew Garfield, Austin Butler, Jeremy Pope, Donald Glover and Tyler James Williams are among the acting nominees who always take the red carpet by storm. “Avatar: The Way of Water,” “Top Gun: Maverick,” “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,” “Better Call Saul,” “The Crown,” “House of the Dragon,” “Hacks,” “Only Murders in the Building” and “Wednesday” are among the hit movies and shows to nab best picture and series noms. The ceremony, hosted for the first time by comedian Jerrod Carmichael, will air on NBC at 5 p.m. PT. Here are some of the best looks from the 2023 Golden Globes, updating live.
