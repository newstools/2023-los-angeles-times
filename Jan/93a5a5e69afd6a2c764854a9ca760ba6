A man has been arrested after allegedly breaking into hip-hop star Drake’s Beverly Hills mansion on Thursday night. The Los Angeles Police Dept. confirmed Friday that officers were called around 9 p.m. to the 9900 block of Kip Drive in Beverly Hills regarding a burglary. Upon arrival, the security guard on the scene who called police about the suspected break-in told them that an unknown white male had made “an unauthorized entry into the property,” LAPD Officer Moore Warren said Friday. (Although the mansion is in Beverly Hills, the property is under the jurisdiction of LAPD’s West Los Angeles Division rather than that of the Beverly Hills Police Dept.) Officers reviewed security camera footage and were able to identify the alleged suspect, whom they detained later near the property. The man was later booked for burglary, Moore said, adding that identifying information about him and the property owner were not being released. It’s also unclear whether any items were taken from the property. TMZ reported that the property belonged to the “Her Loss” rapper, who was not home at the time of the alleged break-in. The suspect was reportedly carrying an item from the home when he was detained, the site said. Representatives for Drake did not immediately respond Friday to The Times’ request for comment.  The 36-year-old musician, who performed two shows at the historic Apollo Theater in New York last weekend, bought the mansion of English singer-songwriter Robbie Williams in early 2022. The estate spans 20,000 square feet on more than 20 acres — boasting an 11-car garage, elevator, wine cellar, 10 bedrooms and at least 22 bathrooms. It is said to have cost the rapper more than $70 million.
