Colombian international Cristian Arango, LAFC’s leading scorer the past two seasons, is leaving MLS for Pachuca of Mexico’s Liga MX, a source close to the player confirmed Tuesday. LAFC did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment. Arango, 27, a striker, scored 30 goals in 51 regular-season games since joining LAFC in August 2021, second-most in MLS over that span. That leaves him third on the team’s all-time scoring list behind Carlos Vela and Diego Rossi. He added two more scores in three playoff games last season. Arango made $683,000 last season, according to figures provided by the MLS players association, ninth-best on the team. He had requested a raise and a contract extension to stay in Los Angeles. LAFC had reportedly rejected a $6.3-million offer for the player from Saudi club Al-Ahli. Arango has made two appearances with Colombia’s national team, the most recent coming last Saturday when he played 45 minutes in a scoreless draw with the U.S. at Dignity Health Sports Park.
