They came out by the hundreds to Redondo Union on Saturday night for the featured basketball game of the Take Flight Challenge — No. 1 Studio City Harvard-Westlake against No. 2 Torrance Bishop Montgomery. The gym seats 2,500, and it was getting pretty cozy in the bleachers, with some in the Bishop Montgomery student section dressed in beach attire and looking for ways to make noise. Brady Dunlap of Harvard-Westlake was having none of it. He made his first five shots and helped the Wolverines open a 15-point lead. That’s when Will Smith of Bishop Montgomery stepped forward, got physical and aggressive, leading to a Knights comeback. The game turned into an epic battle requiring three overtimes to decide a winner. Dunlap and Harvard-Westlake finally prevailed 74-66. Dunlap finished with 38 points. Trent Perry scored only two points in the first half but finished with 15. Smith had 21 points for Bishop Montgomery. “That was a fun game, very tiring,” Dunlap said. In the second overtime, Kelcy Phipps of Bishop Montgomery scored the first two baskets, including a steal off point guard Perry. His third basket of the second overtime put the Knights ahead 62-58. But Dunlap got a basket off a steal, the Wolverines got a rebound and had the ball down by two with 6.6 left. They set a screen on an out of bounds play, and Dunlap scored to send it to a third overtime 62-62. In the third overtime, Harvard-Westlake (17-1) looked refreshed. First Robert Hinton scored, then Dunlap. The shots wouldn’t fall for Bishop Montgomery (18-1). And there were so many people jammed into the gym that they had to keep fans outside waiting to get in for the final game of the night matching Redondo and Narbonne. After the final buzzer, Perry was waving to the Bishop Montgomery fans and blowing them kisses. “We’re competitive. We like it,” Dunlan said. Bishop Montgomery used a 1-2-2 zone defense that bothered the Wolverines. After trailing 23-8, the Knights put together a 26-6 surge. They went ahead on a four-point play by guard La Qwon Cole with 6:21 left in the third quarter. It was back and forth for the rest of regulation.  “They threw something different at me,” Dunlap said of the second and third quarters when he was limited to two baskets. “It took time to getting used to.” Dunlap came back with a vengeance in the fourth quarter and overtime periods, showing much improvement over his junior season when he might have struggled when things weren’t going well. “In the past, I’d lose confidence,” he said. “I couldn’t do that today.” It was a day and night for the top boys’ basketball teams in Southern California to test themselves against elite opponents.
