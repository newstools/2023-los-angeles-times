Five Memphis police officers were released from jail early Friday after they were charged Thursday with second-degree murder  in the brutal beating of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, during a Jan. 7 traffic stop in Memphis. Nichols died in a hospital three days later. The city of Memphis released nearly an hour of graphic video Friday evening that shows the blow-by-blow of a traffic stop that spiraled into a savage display of force, leaving an American city reeling from police violence once again.
