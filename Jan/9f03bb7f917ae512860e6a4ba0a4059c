An armed security guard in Torrance is suspected of  having targeted women who were homeless or addicted to drugs, and coercing at least one of them into sexual activity  in exchange for not reporting her for trespassing, authorities said. Police began to investigate the allegations in early December, officials said in a statement released this week. After the first victim alleged she  had been coerced into sexual activity, Torrance police said they were able to identify  two more victims. Detectives said they believe the suspect was specifically targeting homeless women. The security guard was arrested Dec. 21, but police have not released the guardâ€™s name.   They released only a blurred  photo, saying they did not want to compromise the investigation, according to a department statement. Police released no additional details about when the incidents occurred or where the security guard was working at the time.  They also declined to answer further questions about the incidents or the suspect. Anyone with information about the incidents is asked to contact the Torrance Police Department at (310) 328-3456.
