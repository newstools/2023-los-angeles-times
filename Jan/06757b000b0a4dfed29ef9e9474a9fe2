A series of atmospheric-river storms so far this year have left state ski resorts flush. Mammoth Mountain has received 40 to 54 inches from the latest storm and has already surpassed last year’s season-snowfall total of 310 inches at the Main Lodge and 419 inches at the summit. Farther north, at Palisades Tahoe, the resort has received more than 8½ feet of snow since Jan. 1, and more is on the way. Buckle up.
