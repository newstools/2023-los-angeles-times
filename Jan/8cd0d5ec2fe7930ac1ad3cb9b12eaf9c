A woman’s body was found Thursday morning in a recycling facility near the Northern California city of Eureka, according to authorities. The unidentified woman’s body was found among recycling debris at the Recology recycling facility in Samoa on the northern peninsula of the Humboldt Bay, according to the Eureka Police Department. The woman’s body was likely brought to the facility in a waste hauler’s truck after being picked up within the Eureka city limits, Eureka police spokesperson Brittany Powell said. Police have identified the woman but are waiting for the county coroner’s office to notify the next of kin. An autopsy is scheduled to help in the investigation. The Humboldt County coroner’s office did not immediately respond to requests for more information  on Friday. Anyone with information can contact Det. Donald Bailey with the Eureka Police Department at (707) 441-4215.
