Actor Jeremy Renner was in “critical but stable condition” Sunday after a snow-plowing accident, according to a report from Deadline. The site reported that Renner, who starred in Marvel’s “Hawkeye” series, “The Hurt Locker” and numerous other films, had been airlifted to a hospital and, according to his spokesperson, was with his family. The spokesperson did not say where the accident occurred, but Deadline wrote that the Reno Gazette-Journal has reported that Renner has a home near Lake Tahoe’s Mt. Rose ski area. The Lake Tahoe area has been inundated with snow in recent days after a series of storms walloped Northern California. Renner has been active in the area. The Gazette-Journal reported last year that Renner was involved in local fire protection, and had even purchased a surplus firetruck.
