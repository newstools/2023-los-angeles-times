Tyler Seguin scored twice in the first period, Scott Wedgewood made 34 saves for his first shutout this season and the Dallas Stars beat the Kings 4-0 on Thursday night. Arcadia’s Jason Robertson had a goal and an assist for the Stars, who bounced back after blowing a three-goal lead Wednesday night in a loss at San Jose. Esa Lindell also scored for the Dallas, which moved into the Central Division lead with a Western Conference-best 61 points. Seguin also had an assist to match a season high with three points. It was his 44th multi-goal game with the Stars. Only teammate Jamie Benn has more with Dallas (45) among active skaters. Wedgewood entered 2-2 in his career against the Kings but earned his sixth NHL shutout. The previous one was last March against Tampa Bay. Los Angeles had won four of six but was blanked for the third time since Dec. 8. The Kings were 0 for 4 on the power play after scoring seven times in 18 opportunities this month.  Pheonix Copley, who fell to 12-3, allowed four goals on 17 shots before being pulled. Jonathan Quick stopped seven shots in the remaining 33 minutes. Seguin opened the scoring at 6:54 of the first period when his snap shot from the top of the slot went off the inside of Copley’s blocker and then through his legs.   The Stars’ center then scored his second goal in the opening period for the first time since 2017 with a shot from the left faceoff circle at 17:20. Lindell made it 3-0 just 84 seconds later when his snap shot from the slot hit the post and went in. Robertson chased Copley at 7:27 of the second with his second attempt on a wraparound. Robertson was stopped on his first try before going upstairs and beating Copley on his short side. Robertson has three goals and six points in three games against the Kings this season, along with four goals and seven points in five career meetings.
