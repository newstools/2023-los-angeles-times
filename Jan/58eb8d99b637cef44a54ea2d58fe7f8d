An explosion at a science building at USC injured one person Thursday afternoon, authorities said. The explosion was reported at 4 p.m. at the three-story building at 923 Bloom Walk, Los Angeles Fire Department officials said. The USC Department of Public Safety said a gas leak had occurred at the Neely Petroleum Building. The building was evacuated, and one person — who left the building on their own — was injured, according to fire officials. The person was taken to a hospital with unknown injuries.    The LAFD hazardous materials task squad checked all floors of the building but did not find any ongoing hazards or leaks, and the building was reopened with firefighters remaining on the scene as people returned. The USC Department of Public Safety did not immediately respond to questions Thursday evening.
