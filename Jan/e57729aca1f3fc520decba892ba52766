To the editor: With the recent weather disasters, I have been concerned for those living in California and was shocked to learn that at least 19 people have died because of the recent storms. I was especially moved by the photo of a firefighter rescuing somebody’s beloved animal companion.

The drought is far from over, and we need sustainable answers to our chronic water shortage in Southern California.  Michael Benjamin, Woodland Hills .. To the editor: We needed rain. We prayed for rain. We got rain. Kim Righetti, Upland
