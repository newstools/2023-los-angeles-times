Homicide investigators are searching for a suspect after deputies  found three people shot to death at a home near Montclair on Monday night. Deputies with the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department responded to a home in the 4600 block of Ramona Place shortly after 9 p.m. after receiving reports of three dead people, according to Public Information Officer Mara Rodriguez. All three victims were adults and had gunshot wounds, said Public Information Officer Gloria Huerta. A woman who spoke with  The Times on Tuesday afternoon said the victims were her parents and brother. Yellow crime scene tape blocked off the stuccoed two-story home on Ramona Place, a dead-end street in an unincorporated area just south of Montclair. Multiple vehicles were parked in the yard. Investigators also entered a garage next door to the home, but authorities did not disclose how it was related to their investigation. April Bravo, 26, lives on the next street over and said she usually walks around at night without any hesitation for her safety.  “This is a quiet street,” Bravo said. “It’s a dead-end street, so when anyone comes down, everyone on the street knows it.” Ray Reyes has lived on the block for nearly 30 years and said he could not recall the last time police were called to Ramona Place. “It’s so weird,” Reyes said about the killings. “Nothing like this has ever happened.”  He was at home Monday night but said he did not hear any gunshots or loud noises. Neighbor Chris Sanchez described the people who lived at the home as grandparents and said their grandson in his 20s stayed there sometimes, but he did not know the exact living arrangements. No suspects were in custody as of Tuesday afternoon. This is a developing story. It will be updated when more information is available.
