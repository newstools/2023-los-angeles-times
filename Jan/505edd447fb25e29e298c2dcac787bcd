California will be hit by what National Weather Service officials call a life-threatening rain event beginning Wednesday. “To put it simply, this will likely be one of the most impactful systems on a widespread scale that this meteorologist has seen in a long while,” the NWS said in a forecast for Northern California. “The impacts will include widespread flooding, roads washing out, hillside collapsing, trees down [potentially full groves], widespread power outages, immediate disruption to commerce, and the worst of all, likely loss of human life. This is truly a brutal system that we are looking at and needs to be taken seriously.” “Threat to life likely during this storm,” it added. This follows a massive storm that slammed Northern California over the the weekend, killing at least one person, flooding parts of San Francisco and causing a levee  to break and close a major highway.
