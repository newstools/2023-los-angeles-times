Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of Elvis Presley, collapsed Thursday at a home in the Calabasas area and was having trouble breathing after what is being described as a cardiac episode, a source familiar with the incident told The Times on Thursday. Emergency personnel — an engine and paramedics — responded to a 10:37 a.m. call to a home off Las Virgenes Road, L.A. County Fire Dept. Capt. Sheila Kelliher  confirmed to The Times. At the home, a woman was suffering cardiac arrest, Kelliher said, and was transported to an area hospital. Presley’s manager had “no comment at this time” when contacted Thursday by The Times. Presley, 54, has been living at the home of ex-husband Danny Keough since selling her own Calabasas home after the 2020 suicide death of their 27-year-old son, Benjamin Keough. Presley and her ex — who married in 1988 and divorced in 1994 — have another child together, actor Riley Keough. According to TMZ, Danny Keough performed CPR on his ex-wife until paramedics arrived, and mom Priscilla Presley showed up at the hospital early Thursday afternoon.  “My beloved daughter Lisa Marie was rushed to the hospital. She is now receiving the best care. Please keep her and our family in your prayers,” Priscilla Presley, 77, said in a statement posted on her social media accounts. In addition to her actor daughter, Lisa Marie Presley also has 14-year-old twin daughters, Harper and Finley, whom she shares with ex-husband Michael Lockwood. She was also married briefly to pop icon Michael Jackson and to actor Nicolas Cage.  Lisa Marie and Priscilla Presley and Riley Keough appeared last June at a Hollywood Walk of Fame hand- and footprint ceremony ahead of the release of the Baz Luhrmann movie “Elvis.” On Tuesday, Elvis’ daughter attended the Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, where she joined Austin Butler on the red carpet during an interview. Butler won the award for best actor in a motion picture drama for playing her father in Luhrmann’s film.
