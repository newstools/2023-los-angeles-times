The Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. returns to TV after a one-year hiatus with the 80th Golden Globe Awards Tuesday, airing now on NBC, streaming on Peacock and hosted by comedian Jerrod Carmichael. Prominent nominees include films “The Banshees of Inisherin” (Colin Farrell took home lead actor) and “Everything Everywhere All at Once” (Ke Huy Quan was the night’s first winner) and TV series “Abbott Elementary” (already with 2 wins) and “The White Lotus,” among others. Last year, NBC dropped the broadcast of the 2022 Globes after a Los Angeles Times investigation of the HFPA raised questions about the group’s ethical and financial dealings and also discovered that there were no Black members of the then-87-person assemblage. The association has since approved interim Chief Executive Todd Boehly’s proposal to acquire the Globes, established new bylaws, banned gifts, hired a chief diversity officer and added 21 new members plus 103 international nonmember voters. The winners will be revealed here as they are announced.  “Argentina, 1985” (Argentina, U.S.) | WINNER“All Quiet on the Western Front” (Germany)“Close” (Belgium)“Decision to Leave” (South Korea)“RRR” (India) Cate Blanchett, “Tár” | WINNEROlivia Colman, “Empire of Light”Viola Davis, “The Woman King”Ana de Armas, “Blonde”Michelle Williams, “The Fabelmans” Julia Garner, “Ozark” | WINNERElizabeth Debicki, “The Crown”Hannah Einbinder, “Hacks”Janelle James, “Abbott Elementary”Sheryl Lee Ralph, “Abbott Elementary” Zendaya, “Euphoria” | WINNEREmma D’Arcy, “House of the Dragon”Laura Linney, “Ozark”Imelda Staunton, “The Crown”Hilary Swank, “Alaska Daily” Austin Butler, “Elvis” | WINNERBrendan Fraser, “The Whale”Hugh Jackman, “The Son”Bill Nighy, “Living”Jeremy Pope, “The Inspection” “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio” | WINNER“Inu-Oh”“Marcel the Shell With Shoes On”“Puss in Boots: The Last Wish”“Turning Red”   Michelle Yeoh, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” | WINNERLesley Manville, “Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris”Margot Robbie, “Babylon”Anya Taylor-Joy, “The Menu”Emma Thompson, “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande” Colin Farrell, “The Banshees of Inisherin” | WINNERDiego Calva, “Babylon”Daniel Craig, “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery”Adam Driver, “White Noise”Ralph Fiennes, “The Menu” Quinta Brunson, “Abbott Elementary” | WINNERKaley Cuoco, “The Flight Attendant”Selena Gomez, “Only Murders in the Building”Jenna Ortega, “Wednesday”Jean Smart, “Hacks” Jeremy Allen White, “The Bear” | WINNERDonald Glover, “Atlanta”Bill Hader, “Barry”Steve Martin, “Only Murders in the Building”Martin Short, “Only Murders in the Building”  “Naatu Naatu” by M.M.
