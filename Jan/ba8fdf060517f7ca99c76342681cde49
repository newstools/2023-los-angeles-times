San Francisco quarterback Brock Purdy managed to play most of the second half of a 31-7 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship game after suffering an elbow injury in the first half. Purdy was injured on San Franciscoâ€™s first possession when he was hit by Philadelphia safety Haason Reddick while dropping back to pass. The ball shot high and forward as he drew his arm back and was almost intercepted by an Eagles defender before hitting the ground. Officials  ruled the play a fumble. Purdy was replaced by journeyman Josh Johnson, who has made 20 different stops at NFL teams. He also played in the XFL, AFL and the United Football League. It was the first fumble of the season for Purdy, the final player selected in the 2022 draft. The 49ers were 7-0 with him as the starter before Sunday.
