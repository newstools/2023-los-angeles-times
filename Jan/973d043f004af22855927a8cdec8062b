A magnitude 5.4 earthquake hit Humboldt County, rattling an area hit hard by a damaging temblor last month. The earthquake occurred 26 miles from Eureka, 26 miles from Arcata, 35 miles from McKinleyville and 81 miles from Redding. The Dec. 20 6.4 magnitude quake killed two people and caused widespread damage. The force of the shaking shattered windows, sent objects flying and damaged at least one historic bridge in the small communities south of Eureka. At least 11 people were injured. Officials were assessing damage from the Sunday quake. An average of five earthquakes with magnitudes between 5.0 and 6.0 occur per year in California and Nevada, according to a recent three-year data sample. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 17.3 miles. Did you feel this earthquake? Consider reporting what you felt to the USGS.
