The futuristic Lucas Museum of Narrative Art is quickly changing the landscape of Exposition Park  in Los Angeles. Part spaceship, part education, dining  and retail complex, the  11-acre campus is rising adjacent to L.A. landmarks including Memorial Coliseum and the  space shuttle Endeavour exhibit. The $1-billion museum, funded primarily by filmmaker George Lucas and wife Mellody Hobson, has pushed back its opening date from 2023 to 2025. The two-year delay, the museum says, is due to pandemic complications, specifically supply chain issues that have made the procuring of certain construction materials difficult. The five-story, 300,000-square-foot, futuristic-looking museum was designed by MAD Architects founder Ma Yansong. It has an arched belly, creating a shaded, open-air plaza underneath that visitors can pass through into Exposition Park. The building is primarily composed of steel, glass and concrete along with wood, geofoam, fiberglass-reinforced polymer and plaster.
