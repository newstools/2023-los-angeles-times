Point guard MJ Coleman of Brentwood made a sudden, swift move to the basket Tuesday night similar to the way he raced toward the end zone en route to scoring 12 touchdowns in the fall as a receiver. It took him a month to lose 10 pounds from football season and regain his basketball speed and agility, and what a player he is for 17-2 Brentwood. “When he’s out there, he’s my security blanket,” coach Ryan Bailey said. Coleman scored 11 points in the first quarter and set the tone for Brentwood, which improved to 3-0 in the Gold Coast League after an 88-77 victory over host Campbell Hall. Parker Turner led Brentwood with 23 points. Jordan Houegban made five threes and had 17 points, Coleman scored 15 points and James Olofson added 12 points and 10 rebounds. Tanner Jones scored 18 points for Campbell Hall, which fell behind 27-7 and trailed by as many as 20 points in the third quarter before getting as close as eight points in the fourth quarter. Asked about Brentwood’s success, Coleman said, “I think it’s because we play together. We know our roles and love each other.” It also helps to have Bailey as coach. He used 11 players in the first half, called timeouts when needed and somehow has his team winning without much size. “No, I’m not surprised,” Bailey said. “I know what my guys can do. We embrace the underdog role.”   Crossroads kept pace with Brentwood by securing a 62-57 victory over Windward. Isaiah Chappell led Crossroads with 22 points. Nasir Luna had 14 points for Windward.
