With four brothers and four sisters walking him onto the court for senior night, Tyler Rolison of St. Bernard told coach Tony Bland before its game Monday night against 24-1 Bishop Montgomery, “I’m not losing on senior night.” Rolison played like someone who couldn’t be stopped, scoring 34 points to help St. Bernard upset the Knights 70-61 and pull into a first-place tie in the Del Rey League. “I came in with the mindset I’m not losing,” Rolison said. “It was important to me. I had to put on a show.” St. Bernard (20-5, 6-1) has created uncertainty in the final week of the regular season as speculation grows regarding which eight teams will be selected for the Southern Section Open Division playoffs. The Vikings have thrust themselves into the playoff picture, adding drama to Sunday’s unveiling of the brackets. St. Bernard is growing up before everyone’s eyes. In the fourth quarter, Bishop Montgomery (24-2, 6-1) appeared to be launching a comeback when a group of young St. Bernard players stepped forward. Sophomore Tajh Ariza hit a three. Sophomore Caleb Versher was four for four on free throws. Sophomore Josh Palmer made a clutch basket. In the end, though, it was Rolison delivering despite St. Bernard falling behind 8-0 to start the game when Bland played all the seniors. “Tyler was amazing,” Bland said.
