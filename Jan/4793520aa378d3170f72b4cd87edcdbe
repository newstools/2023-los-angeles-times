The nominations for the 2023 Academy Awards were announced early Tuesday morning by actors Riz Ahmed and Allison Williams, accompanied by the usual gasps, cheers, snubs and surprises. Crowd-pleasing mind-bender “Everything Everywhere All at Once” led the pack with 11, followed by Netflix’s German war movie “All Quiet on the Western Front” and the Irish dark comedy “The Banshees of Inisherin” with nine and “Elvis” with eight. Box office triumphs “Top Gun: Maverick,” “Black Panther: Wakanda Forver” and “Avatar: The Way of Water” landed 6, 5 and 4, respectively. The finalists in all 23 categories were revealed in two parts via livestream on Oscar.com and Oscars.org, along with the motion picture academy’s social media accounts (Twitter, YouTube and Facebook). The 95th Academy Awards will be held March 12 at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood and televised live on ABC.
