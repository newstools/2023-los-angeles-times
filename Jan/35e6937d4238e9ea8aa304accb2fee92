To the editor: “This is a red flag for the country,” said the mayor of Newport News, Va., in response to a 6-year-old shooting his first-grade teacher with a gun at a local school. In the same print edition, it was reported that gun enthusiasts finally got a federal Court of Appeals to reject the bump-stock ban enacted in response to the Las Vegas massacre that killed 60 people. Another article reported that Democratic officials’ homes and offices were shot up in New Mexico. None of these should be a surprise, since the U.S. now has the distinction of having more guns than residents and all three states are open-carry states.
