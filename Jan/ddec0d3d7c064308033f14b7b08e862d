Al Roker will return to NBC’s “Today” show this week after a months-long medical hiatus. The morning news program announced Tuesday that Roker, 68, will be back in the studio at Rockefeller Plaza on Friday. The veteran weatherman has been in and out of the hospital since mid-November while receiving treatment for blood clots. Roker — who has long been open about his health struggles — appeared virtually on “Today” last month to update viewers on his condition, calling his recent time in the hospital “a tough slog.” “I’m not gonna deny this. This has been the hardest [hospitalization] yet and you know I’ve had my share of surgeries,” the newscaster said via video. “But it gives you a profound sense of gratitude for this outpouring of prayers and thanks. I’m a very fortunate person.” In November, Roker was admitted to the hospital for blood clots in his leg and lungs. He briefly returned home around Thanksgiving before landing in the hospital again “due to some complications.”  Roker confirmed Dec. 8 via social media that he had been released from the hospital and has since been busy celebrating the holidays with his family, according to his Instagram feed. “I’ve missed you all so, so very much, all these faces,” Roker said last month on  the “Today” show. “It just means the world to me and to our family and my [wife], Deborah, who’s just been my rock. I thank you so much. I really appreciated it.” His history of operations includes two knee replacements, gastric bypass, hip replacement, surgeries for carpal tunnel and back issues, plus a prostate cancer-related procedure in November 2020.
